## Characters

Giant Mutant Bugs: The giant mutant bug characters are represented by AI bug sprites and are controlled by the computer/AI.

Hero: The hero character is pictured by a human sprite and is controlled by you, the player.

## Playing the game

Introduction: Robin's Bugger Game is a simplified throwback to the original 1981 Frogger Arcade game originally developed by Konami. Newer graphics have been utilized to modernize & differentiate it from Konami's original arcade game.

Goal: The goal of the game is to move our hero from the grassy knoll to the riverside safely, dodging the giant mutant bugs busily running down the road.

Gameplay: Using your keyboard's arrow keys (right: →, left: ←, up: ↑, down: ↓), move the hero character carefully to the edge of the grassy knoll. Then, proceed to carefully move the hero across the road, timing your moves to coincide with the gaps between the giant mutant bugs. The game will end when the hero character reaches the riverside. Be careful, they move quickly! When the hero character is hit by a giant mutant bug, the game will automatically start over and our hero will respawn back in the grassy knoll.

Completion: The game comes to an end when our hero reaches the riverside successfully. When victory is achieved, a window will prompt the player with the option to play again.
